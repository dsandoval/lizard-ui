<h1>Content area</h1>
<p>
  This is the content area, btw.  Here you can put for instance:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The big main map.
  </li>
  <li>
    An edit form for the current object.
  </li>
  <li>
    A bunch of graphs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>About the bar</h2>
<p>
  The bar above the sidebar and this content area is divided into three areas:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The sidebar header.
  </li>
  <li>
    A couple of "object tabs": click them and you get a different view for the
    currently viewed object.  Object is kinda loose: it can be a selected area
    or a specific report or the homepage.  But for a selected area you might
    want to show an overview with graphs, a table with raw data and an edit
    form.  That's where "object tabs" are for.
  </li>
  <li>
    A couple of "object actions".  Terminology is a bit borrowed from Plone
    (big python CMS) where they've really nailed down the concept of a
    pluggable interface, btw.  Actions are things like "print" and "export"
    (and perhaps "edit", though that can be a tab, too).
  </li>
</ol>
