Changelog of lizard-ui
======================


0.7 (unreleased)
----------------

- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.


0.6 (2010-04-28)
----------------

- Added collapsible sidebar.

- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The
  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up
  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so
  switching back to blueprint is now possible.

- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.


0.5 (2010-04-13)
----------------

- Layout improvements.

- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).

- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.

- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't
  included automatically anymore.

- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.
