Changelog of lizard-ui
======================


0.12 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.11 (2010-06-08)
-----------------

- Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base
  treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.


0.10 (2010-06-07)
-----------------

- Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().

- Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.


0.9 (2010-06-03)
----------------

- Using jquery's live() for "late binding" of events to elements added later
  through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.


0.8 (2010-06-01)
----------------

- Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.


0.7 (2010-05-18)
----------------

- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.

- Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed
  div at the bottom.

- Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.


0.6 (2010-04-28)
----------------

- Added collapsible sidebar.

- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The
  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up
  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so
  switching back to blueprint is now possible.

- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.


0.5 (2010-04-13)
----------------

- Layout improvements.

- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).

- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.

- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't
  included automatically anymore.

- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.


0.4 (2010-03-16)
----------------

- Added extjs javascript library.

- Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.


0.3.1 (2010-03-05)
------------------

- Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.


0.3 (2010-03-05)
----------------

- Added openlayers 2.8.

- Added famfamfam silk icon set.

- Added background to menubar, footer and body.

- Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.


0.2 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in
  templates.  We're well-behaved now!


0.1 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.

- Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript
  resources.
